## Experiment Overview
This assignment focuses on exploring **dimensionality reduction techniques** on high-dimensional gene expression data. The primary goal was to compare **t-SNE** and **Isomap** for visualization and analysis.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Scaling and cleaning of the gene expression dataset.
2. **t-SNE Visualization:**  
   - Explored multiple perplexities (5, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80).  
   - Observed cluster cohesion, separation, and local neighborhood structures.  
   - Identified noisy points, outliers, and hard-to-learn samples.
3. **Isomap Visualization:**  
   - Applied Isomap with `n_neighbors=5` and `10`.  
   - Analyzed the global structure of the data manifold.  
   - Compared Isomap vs. t-SNE for capturing local vs. global relationships.
